## About Project

I did a tutorial from Laracast called ELOQUENT RELATIONSHIPS. The tutorial teaches the basic relations that are usually used and how to use them. Is a really easy tutorial but there is a lot of small details that you can learn watching videos like this.
It teaches you about the following relations:

- [One to one].
- [One to many].
- [Many to many].
- [Has many through].
- [Polymorphic Relations].

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Interesting things or things that I learn

Again, it was a very easy tutorial but there were some details I didn't know that I actually came up on the project that I'm working.

- Laravel treats pivot table name using the singular form of the parent tables and then order them alphabetically, so if you have to tables, users and posts, the pivot table would be user_post.
- Using the function ->withTimestamps() in your relation, populates the timestamps.
-I learn about the 'hasManyThrough' relation since I have never used it before.
